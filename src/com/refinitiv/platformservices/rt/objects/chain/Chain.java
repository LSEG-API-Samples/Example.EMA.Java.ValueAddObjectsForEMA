 * The root interface of chains. A <code>Chain</code> represents a specific type

 * From a pure semantic point of view a chain can be considered as a list of 
 * instruments names. A chain is actually made of a chained list of <code>Chain 
 * Records</code> that are <code>MarketPrice</code> instruments that contain 
 * names of other instruments. <code>Chain Records</code> also contain additional
 * fields that link them together (More details about chains data structure are
 * available in <a href="https://developers.refinitiv.com/en/article-catalog/article/simple-chain-objects-ema-part-1" target="_blank">this article</a> 
 * available on the  <a href="https://developers.refinitiv.com" 
 * target="_blank">Refinitiv Developer Portal</a> ).
 * A <code>Chain</code> is an object that subscribes to the underlying 
 * linked list of <code>Chain Records</code> of a given chain and that retrieves 
 * the contained instruments names for you.
