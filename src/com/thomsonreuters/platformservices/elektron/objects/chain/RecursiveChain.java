/**
 * The interface of a <code>Chain</code> implementation you can use to open 
 * recursive chains. On the contrary of <code>FlatChain</code>s <code>RecursiveChain</code>s
 * are meant to recursively open chains that contain other chains. This is very 
 * handy for some use cases but this also comes with a limitation: you cannot 
 * open a <code>RecursiveChain</code> with updates. <code>RecursiveChain</code>s 
 * must be built using a <code>RecursiveChain.Builder</code>. As an example, the 
 * code snippet below creates and opens the Equity Markets chain that has a max 
 * depth of 4 levels:
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <pre>
 *    OmmConsumer ommConsumer = ...;
 *      .
 *      .
 *      .
 *    RecursiveChain theChain = new RecursiveChain.Builder()
 *           .withOmmConsumer(ommConsumer)
 *           .withChainName("0#EQUITYMARKETS")
 *           .withServiceName("ELEKTRON_DD")
 *           .build();
 * 
 *    theChain.open();
 * </pre>
 * There are more parameters you can use with <code>RecursiveChain</code> objects.
 * They must be set at built time via a {@link RecursiveChain.Builder}. Please 
 * refer to this class for the exhaustive list.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <strong>Note that this implementation of <code>RecursiveChain</code> is 
 * synchronized</strong>. It can be used indifferently with the <code>API_DISPATCH</code> 
 * and <code>USER_DISPATCH</code> <code>OmmConsumer</code> operation models.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * Below is an excerpt of the Equity Markets chain elements:
 * <br>
