/**
 * The interface of a <code>Chain</code> implementation you can use to open flat
 * chains (meaning non recursive chains). <code>FlatChain</code>s must be built 
 * using a <code>FlatChain.Builder</code>. As an example, the code snippet 
 * below creates and opens a <code>FlatChain</code> for the Dow Jones chain 
 * published on the ELEKTRON_DD service:
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <pre>
 *    OmmConsumer ommConsumer = ...;
 *      .
 *      .
 *      .
 *    FlatChain theChain = new FlatChain.Builder()
 *                  .withOmmConsumer(ommConsumer)
 *                  .withChainName("0#.DJI")
 *                  .withServiceName("ELEKTRON_DD")
 *                  .build();
 * 
 *    theChain.open();
 * </pre>
 * <br>
 * There are more parameters you can use with <code>FlatChain</code> objects. 
 * They must be set at built time via a {@link FlatChain.Builder}. Please refer 
 * to this class for the exhaustive list.
 * <br>
 * <strong>Note that this implementation of FlatChains is synchronized</strong>. It 
 * can be used indifferently with the <code>API_DISPATCH</code> and 
 * <code>USER_DISPATCH</code> <code>OmmConsumer</code> operation models.
