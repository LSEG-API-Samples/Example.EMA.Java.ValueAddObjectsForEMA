 * instruments names. A chain is actually made of a chained list of <code>Chain 
 * Records</code> that are <code>MarketPrice</code> instruments that contain 
 * names of other instruments. <code>Chain Records</code> also contain additional
 * fields that link them together (More details about chains data structure are

 * A <code>Chain</code> is an object that subscribes to the underlying 
 * linked list of <code>Chain Records</code> of a given chain and that retrieves
