/**
 * The interface of a <code>MarketPrice</code> implementation that you can use
 * to open level 1 instruments published on the real-time platform (Elektron 
 * or TREP). <code>MarketPrice</code>s must be built using a <code>MarketPrice.Builder</code>.
 * As an example, the code snippet below creates and opens the EUR/USD currency 
 * quote (EUR=) <code>MarketPrice</code> published on the ELEKTRON_DD service:
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <pre>
 *    OmmConsumer ommConsumer = ...;
 *      .
 *      .
 *      .
 *      MarketPrice theMarketPrice = new MarketPrice.Builder()
 *           .withOmmConsumer(ommConsumer)
 *           .withName("EUR=")
 *           .withServiceName("ELEKTRON_DD")
 *           .build();
 * 
 *      theMarketPrice.open();
 * </pre>
 * <br>
 * There are more parameters you can use with <code>MarketPrice</code> objects. 
 * They must be set at built time via a {@link MarketPrice.Builder}. Please refer 
 * to this class for the exhaustive parameters list.
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <strong>Note that this implementation of <code>MarketPrice</code> is synchronized</strong>. 
 * It can be used indifferently with the <code>API_DISPATCH</code> and 
 * <code>USER_DISPATCH</code> <code>OmmConsumer</code> operation models.
